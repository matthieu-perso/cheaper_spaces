# CHEAPER SPACES
Space exploration on the cheap: the `images` folder contains the 49 shapes used as materials in Douven (2016); the `random` folder contains 100 container shapes generated by the `random.tex` file. The file `fit3d.csv` contains the coordinates of the 49 shapes in the 3D Manhattan space from Douven (2016) and `final_grad.csv` are the average degrees of vasehood reported in Douven (2016).
