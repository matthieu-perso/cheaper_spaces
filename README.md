# CHEAPER SPACES
Space exploration on the cheap. 

This repository is composed of a `data` folder, which contains both images and similarity matrices and a `notebooks` folder containing our code. 

Within the data folder, the `images` folder contains the 49 shapes used as materials in Douven (2016); the `generated_images` folder contains 100 container shapes generated by the `random.tex` file. The file `fit3d.csv` contains the coordinates of the 49 shapes in the 3D Manhattan space from Douven (2016) and `final_grad.csv` are the average degrees of vasehood reported in Douven (2016).

## Notebooks

Contains the notebook where the rest of the data is selected. 

Colab notebooks were used to interface with Python when necessary. The Colab notebooks can be accessed at this link : https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hjQj5ntvNZV1Z7h2EniKEWDM38z7YX5B?usp=sharing
